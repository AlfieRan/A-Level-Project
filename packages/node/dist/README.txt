This is the example node program for mining on the MonoChain network.

Mining is a process based upon giving up some of your computer's power to a blockchain network.
In exchange, you receive a small percentage of any transactions that are processed on your computer in MonoCoins,
the standard currency for the MonoChain network.

To run this program you will need node, a program that allows you to run javascript directly on your computer.
 - node the js interpreter is not related or associated with the MonoChain network in any way.
 - It just happens to share a name with this type of mining software.

It is also recommended that you understand what you are doing as you will need to use the console to start your node.

To start working for the MonoChain Network open your console, navigate to wherever you have installed this software,
then type "node /code/index.js"
