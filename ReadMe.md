**Alfie Ranstead's A Level Project - A JSON Oriented Blockchain**
---
This git repo uses a monorepo in order to keep the various sections of the project in one repository, to view individual parts of the project, visit the "/packages" folder.

The packages listed in the packages folder are as follows:
 * Documentation - the documentation for the whole project
 * Node - The code that runs on a computer intending to use it's storage or cpu power alongside it's network connection in order to support the blockchain and recieve a percentage of transactions that flow through it in return.
 * Webportal - An example website that allows Users of the blockchain to see the data they own on the blockchain and send transactions to other Users on the blockchain.

It's also important to note that this repository exists in two places:
 * Within My Sixth Form's project organisation - https://github.com/Marling-CS-Projects/AlfieRanstead-alevel-project/tree/master
 * And on my personal github account - https://github.com/AlfieRan/A-Level-Project

However it is important to note that the repo on my personal account does not include the documentation for this project as that is only stored within the "docs" branch on the Marling-CS-Projects repo.
